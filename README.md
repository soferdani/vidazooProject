# ads.txt Project

This project was created as part of the home assignment, the idea was to create a full-stack application that receives contact sites like www.msn.com and pars its ads.txt file into information.
The front is written with React without TS unfortunately because lack of time, and the backend has one post route that receives domain, go and bring the ads.txt file -> parse it -> send it back to the front that shows the information in a nice react bootstrap table.
